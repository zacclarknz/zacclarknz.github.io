                        This tool was built for local authorities to help them monitor the housing market.
                        It includes a number of simple indicators I built, includng a quality adjusted house price index: the Sales Price Appraisal Ratio (SPAR).
                        I also created one of the price efficiency indicators, a measure of competitiveness in the developable land market: the Land Concentration Control Measures.
                        This includes an innovative application of the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) to the urban land market. 
                        In order to create the measure I had to combine data from across many different agencies.
                        See the technical guide method section I wrote <a href="http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/housing-property/pdf-document-library/land-ownership-control-indicators-technical-report.pdf">here.</a>

                        I used R to generate a short HTML report of the recent data released by Stats NZ on the activity of foreign buyers in property transfers. 
                        This includes an R generated HTML report with an interactive heat map (chloropeth).

                        I used R to process geospatial data, then a combination of javascript libraries were used to create dynamic crossfiltered maps and charts.
                        When you change one chart all the other charts and data-table dynamically change.
