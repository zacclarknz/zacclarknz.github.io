                        This tool was built for councils to help monitor the housing market.
                        It includes a number of simple indicators, includng a quality adjusted house price index, Sales Price Appraisal Ratio (SPAR).
                        I also created one of the price efficiency indicators, a measure of competitiveness in the developable land market called the land concentration of control measures.
                        This includes an innovative application of the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) to the urban land market.
                        See the technical guide I wrote <a href="http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/housing-property/pdf-document-library/land-ownership-control-indicators-technical-report.pdf">here.</a>

                        I looked into the recent data released by Stats NZ on the activity of foreign buyers in property transfers. 
                        Includes a R generated html report with interactive chloropeth.

                        I used R to process geospatial data, then a combination of javascript libraries are used to create dynamic crossfiltered maps and charts.
                        When you change one chart all the other charts dynamically change.
